    "For the first model I started by adding batch normalization. This increased the test accuracy, but not enough to get to 75% consistently. After that i tested different layer sizes and found that doubling the number of filters in the convolutional layers increased the accuracy further. Now the test accuracy was usually around 75% but not always. Finally i reduced the batch size to 32, which increased the accuracy further and gave a consistent test accuracy of 75%-77%. \n",

    "For the second model I started by switching to the Adam optimizer. To get the new optimizer to converge I also had to reduce the learning rate to 0.001. Next I tested some different network architectures and ended up using a structure with two convolutional layers for each pooling layer. The model was not reaching satisfactory accuracy and it stopped very early, usually after 4 epochs. To avoid finding local minimas which makes it stop early I added dropout after every layer, but figured out the model performed better when I only had dropout after each convolutional layer and not in the fully connected layer. The dropout worked better when it had a low probability parameter, where the best value was 10%. The model was not performing well enough yet, with a test accuracy of 72%. The final change was reducing the kernel size of the convolutional layers to 3, which resulted in a test accuracy of 75% consistently.\n",
